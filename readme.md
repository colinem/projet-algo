How it works
------------
The programm will parse the two files .gr and .co, to get a graph with all points.
It will calculate the shortest path between the starting point and the end point you specify.
If you don't specify points then it will take the first point as starting point and the last point as end point by default.

How to use it
-------------
Execute the Main with one or three arguments.
If one argument :
- file name without extension
If three arguments :
- file name without extension
- starting point
- end point
