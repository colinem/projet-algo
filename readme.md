How it works
------------
The program will parse the two files .gr and .co, to get a graph with all points.

It will calculate the shortest path between the starting point and the end point you specify.

If you don't specify points then it will take the first point as starting point and the last point as end point by default.

How to use it
-------------
Execute the Main with one or three arguments.

You have to put your file .gr and .co in the directory _resources_ .

If one argument :
- file name without extension

If three arguments :
- file name without extension
- starting point
- end point
